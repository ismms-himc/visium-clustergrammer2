## Data

### 10X Visium Dataset
The [10X Visium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/spatial-transcriptomics/) data was obtained from from [10x Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/). The data was not included in this repo because of GitHub size limitations but can be easily obtained from [10x Genomics Datasets](https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/).

### Reference Dataset
Similarly to the [Seurat spatial vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.1/spatial_vignette.html) we used a [single cell RNA-seq dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4216) (~14,000 Mouse cortical cells produced by the Allen Institute) as a reference dataset for labeling the Visium data.


## References
This project was influenced by the [Seurat spatial vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.1/spatial_vignette.html) from the [Satija lab](https://satijalab.org/) and we are very grateful for thier public examples.
